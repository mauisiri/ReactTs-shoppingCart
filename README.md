# Shopping Cart Feature:
## Overview
This project is a code callenge of a responsive shopping cart application built using React and TypeScript.<br>  
It demonstrates a dynamic product listing and a shopping cart component, where products can be added and removed from the cart.<br>  
The application fetches product data from a local JSON file and updates the product list and total cost dynamically based on user interactions.<br> <br>

As a code callenge, a list of requirements need to be performed. To make it more visual, I have marked the ✅ **Achieved** and 🔨 **Pending/in progress** requirements with icons.

### **General Requirements:**

✅ The codebase should be written in TypeScript and follow a modular approach.<br> 
🔨 Each component must have accompanying unit tests.<br> 
✅ Efficient and mindful resource use and performance optimisation.<br> 
✅ Prioritise functionality over aesthetic precision.<br> 

### **Additional Points of Interest:**

✅ **- State management:** use of hooks
✅ **- Performance optimisation:** popups added
✅ **- A mobile-first development approach**
✅ **- Code simplicity and readability:** SOLID principles used
✅ **- Component design**
🔨 **- Error handling**
✅ **- Testing**: React Testing Library and Jest
🔨 **- Accessibility**
✅ **- Use of external libraries:** react-modal
✅ **- Project setup**

### Features
✅**- Product Listing:** Displays a list of products fetched from a local JSON file. Users can add products to the cart until they are out of stock.<br> 
✅**- Shopping Cart:** Displays products added to the cart, the total quantity of items, and the total cost. Users can remove products from the cart.<br> 
✅**- Responsive Design:** On mobile screens, the cart is displayed as a sticky section at the bottom, showing only the total cost and quantity of items.<br> 
✅**- TypeScript Support:** The project is fully typed using TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability.<br> 
✅**- Testing:** Includes unit tests for key functionalities to ensure the application works as expected.<br> <br> 

##Technologies Used
**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.<br> 
**TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.<br> 
**Jest and React Testing Library: Used for writing and running unit tests.<br> <br> 

##Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

### Clone the repository:

1. Open your bash and navigate to the location where you want to create your project and execute:<br> 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-cart.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:<br> 
cd shopping-cart

3. Install the dependencies executing:<br> 
npm install

4. Run the project:<br> 
npm start
<br> 
This command will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.<br> 

The page will automatically reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

5. Run the tests:<br> 
npm test
<br> 


### API
The application uses a mock API to fetch product data from a JSON file. The products.json file is located in the public directory and contains an array of product objects.

### Testing
To run the unit tests, use the following command:<br> 
npm test<br> 
This command will run Jest in watch mode and execute all test files matching the *.test.tsx pattern.
