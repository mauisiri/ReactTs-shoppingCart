# Shopping Cart Feature

## Overview
This project is a code challenge involving the development of a responsive shopping cart application built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It demonstrates a dynamic product listing and shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add and remove products from the cart. The application fetches product data from a local JSON file and updates the product list and total cost dynamically based on user interactions.

### Requirements

As part of this challenge, several requirements have been addressed. <br> 
To highlight progress, the following icons are used: âœ… **Achieved** and ðŸ”¨ **Pending/In Progress**.

#### **General Requirements**
- âœ… The codebase is written in TypeScript and follows a modular approach.
- ðŸ”¨ Each component will have accompanying unit tests.
- âœ… Efficient resource use and performance optimization are implemented.
- âœ… Functionality is prioritized over aesthetic precision.

#### **Additional Points of Interest**
- âœ… **State management:** Managed using React hooks.
- âœ… **Performance optimization:** Popups are optimized for performance.
- âœ… **Mobile-first development:** Responsive design implemented.
- âœ… **Code simplicity and readability:** SOLID principles are followed.
- âœ… **Component design:** Components are well-structured and modular.
- âœ… **Error handling:** Implemented to catch and manage potential issues.
- âœ… **Testing:** Using React Testing Library and Jest.
- ðŸ”¨ **Accessibility:** Accessibility improvements are ongoing.
- âœ… **External libraries:** Utilized libraries like `react-modal` for better UX.
- âœ… **Project setup:** Fully configured for smooth development and testing.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a dynamic list of products fetched from a local JSON file. Users can add products to the cart until stock runs out.
- **Shopping Cart**: Shows products added to the cart, total quantity, and total cost. Users can also remove products from the cart.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views. On mobile, the cart is displayed as a sticky section at the bottom, showing only the total cost and quantity.
- **TypeScript Support**: The entire project is fully typed with TypeScript, ensuring better code quality and maintainability.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests for core functionalities to ensure reliability.
